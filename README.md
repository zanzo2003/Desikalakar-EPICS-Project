# DesiKalakaar: Empowering Indian Artisans

DesiKalakaar is an EPICS (Engineering Projects in Community Service) project aimed at establishing a digital marketplace specifically for Indian artisans. Our goal is to empower artisans by providing them with a platform to showcase and sell their unique crafts to a global audience. We focus on less mainstream crafts like Dhokra art, Phulkari embroidery, and Channapatna toys, with the aim of preventing the extinction of these age-old practices while promoting cultural heritage.

## Objectives
- Establish a digital marketplace for Indian artisans.
- Enable artisans to reach a global audience.
- Focus on less mainstream crafts to prevent their extinction.
- Revive and preserve heritage crafts of India.

## Technologies Used
DesiKalakaar is built using the MERN stack, which includes:
- MongoDB: For database storage.
- Express.js: For building the backend API.
- React.js: For building the frontend user interface.
- Node.js: For server-side JavaScript execution.
